## General considerations 
- what's the name/idea/purpose of the event?
- (if at the Space) is there permission from the [management](https://wiki.comakingspace.de/Management)?
- is there a fixed date and time yet?
- is there a registration deadline (if yes, please include a link to the form)?
- how many people are needed to organize it on the day of the event?
- are there any concrete tasks to be done in advance?
- what part of the work would you take over?

*to make sure your idea is visible, you should also share this "issue" via slack and/or Telegram and ask for help there!*
