# Do Something

This is our issue tracker for open tasks in the rooms of [CoMakingSpace](https://comakingspace.org) or our online resources.

Are you bored or just a nice person? Go through the [task list](https://github.com/comakingspace/do-something/issues) and select one you can do. Report your progress in the issue for coordination and karma.

Besides the changing tasks in the list, an "issue" that is always open is adding content to the [wiki](https://wiki.comakingspace.de/). Whether you write about a project or create a page from the [wanted list](https://wiki.comakingspace.de/Special:WantedPages), the others will be grateful for any bit of shared wisdom!

There might be wiki pages without a picture, feel free to take a photo and add it to the page to illustrate it. Just search for

* [machine pages without a picture](https://wiki.comakingspace.de/Special:WhatLinksHere/File:Machine-default.png),
